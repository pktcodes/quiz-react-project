#### Quiz consists of a straight forward user interface where there is a
- **Setup form** to choose the different options for the game i.e *the number of questions*, *the type of category* and *the level of difficulty* of the quiz user wants to take by clicking on the **Play Quiz** button.
- Depending on the options, a set of questions will be fetched/generated and all the data is handled by the **API**.
- User will be taken to the next question once any answer is selected from the multiple choice or can skip to the next question directly by clicking **Next Question** button.
- As the user is answering the questions, user can view the correct answers out of the total questions on the top right of the form.
- Once the user completes the quiz by answering all questions, automatically a pop-up modal will show the results and the user has the choice to click **Play again** button.
- To run the project locally, clone the repo, `npm install` to install the dependencies, and `npm start` to start up the development server on default port 3000.
